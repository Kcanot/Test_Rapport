  abstract = {The soil status inside and outside the chemical ACNA factory (Cengio, Italy) has been investigated by assessing chemical and biological parameters. Three sites, two (A and B) located inside the so-called high-risk zone and one (C) outside the factory were considered. Chemical analysis performed in the first metre of depth indicated the presence of inorganic pollution (copper and arsenic) in site A and organic (1,2,3,4-tetrachlorobenzene and 2,4-dichloroaniline) and inorganic (arsenic and mercury) contaminations in site B. Site C did not show any significant contamination and was considered as control. Biological analyses were performed by evaluating functional (substrate utilization pattern and enzymatic activities of the soil extracts) and structural (bacterial population density, composition and structure) diversity of the soil bacterial community as indicator of soil health. Moreover, 20 bacterial strains per site, able to grow on minimal medium added with 2,4-dichloroaniline as sole carbon source, were selected and identified. The metabolic profile of soil extracts, characterized by using Biolog GN MicroPlates, coupled with hierarchical clustering, showed a high similarity between the microbial communities isolated from sites A and B. The highest amounts of enzymatic activities were recorded in site C. Bacterial density in all sites did not differ significantly and a prevalence of r-strategist (fast growing and copiotrophic) bacteria was observed. The composition of the bacterial community showed a higher similarity between sites A and B than with site C. Only few bacterial species were common to the three sites: as a consequence, a prevalence of bacterial species typically associated to each site was observed. The fraction of bacteria able to grow on 2,4-dichloroaniline as sole carbon source on the total culturable bacteria in each site was lower than 0.1\%. Bacterial identifications were performed by using Biolog MicroPlates. By considering the bacterial strains able to grow on minimal medium added with 2,4-dichloroaniline, a higher similarity between sites A and C than with B site was recorded. In conclusion, the presence of different chemical pollutants did not affect the bacterial density but rather the community structure. The characterization of soil chemical properties, metabolic fingerprinting, enzymatic activities and bacterial community structure could be useful tools for the evaluation of the soil health.},

  abstract = {Antibiotics are widely used in animal husbandry, and various types of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are frequently detected in livestock waste around the world. Conventional livestock waste treatment processes do not completely remove ARGs, resulting in their release to soil and water environments. Various exposure routes of these ARGs to humans, including inhalation and ingestion of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) that harbor them, may be contributing to the rise in resistant clinical infections that are increasingly difficult to treat with antibiotics. In this review, we assess the occurrence and variability of ARGs in livestock wastes and their potential propagation pathways to human pathogens. We also review the mechanisms and environmental factors that influence the dissemination of ARGs through these pathways, and evaluate the ARG removal efficiency of common livestock waste management approaches. Challenges and research needs for assessing and mitigating the risk of antibiotic resistance dissemination from livestock waste are also presented.},

  abstract = {Background D-lactic acidosis is characterized by brain fogginess (BF) and elevated D-lactate and occurs in short bowel syndrome. Whether it occurs in patients with an intact gut and unexplained gas and bloating is unknown. We aimed to determine if BF, gas and bloating is associated with D-lactic acidosis and small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). Methods Patients with gas, bloating, BF, intact gut, and negative endoscopic and radiological tests, and those without BF were evaluated. SIBO was assessed with glucose breath test (GBT) and duodenal aspiration/culture. Metabolic assessments included urinary D-lactic acid and rblood L-lactic acid, and ammonia levels. Bowel symptoms, and gastrointestinal transit were assessed. Results Thirty patients with BF and 8 without BF were evaluated. Abdominal bloating, pain, distension and gas were the most severe symptoms and their prevalence was similar between groups. In BF group, all consumed probiotics. SIBO was more prevalent in BF than non-BF group (68 vs. 28\%, p\,=\,0.05). D-lactic acidosis was more prevalent in BF compared to non-BF group (77 vs. 25\%, p\,=\,0.006). BF was reproduced in 20/30 (66\%) patients. Gastrointestinal transit was slow in 10/30 (33\%) patients with BF and 2/8 (25\%) without. Other metabolic tests were unremarkable. After discontinuation of probiotics and a course of antibiotics, BF resolved and gastrointestinal symptoms improved significantly (p\,=\,0.005) in 23/30 (77\%). Conclusions We describe a syndrome of BF, gas and bloating, possibly related to probiotic use, SIBO, and D-lactic acidosis in a cohort without short bowel. Patients with BF exhibited higher prevalence of SIBO and D-lactic acidosis. Symptoms improved with antibiotics and stopping probiotics. Clinicians should recognize and treat this condition.},
